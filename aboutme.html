<center><h3>Biography</h3></center>
<center><div> My name is Frank Hogan and this is my second year studying at UMaine but my first year in the business school. Last year I was a kinesthiology major but since then I have changed my major to business management. I am from Belmont, Massachusetts which is a small town right outside of Boston. Post graduation, I plan on getting a job for a large company with benefits and attempt to work my way up the ranks over time if it is something I enjoy.</div></center>
